Brilliant we've now got all the errors appearing to the screen but what happens if you try to resubmit the form with different values?
The error messages from the first submission are still hanging about. We need a method to clear the error messages each time before we start validating.

Create a function to clear the errors and call it at the start of your validate function.

*** Think about what all the error divs have in commmon ***

Once you've done it try submitting the form multiple times with different fields populated and see if you get the expected response.
